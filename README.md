Analysis of flip rates from juvenile performance experiment from temperature manuscript

Juvenile performance exp (2023)
We assigned 7-8 month post-settlement juveniles randomly into three treatment groups according to their experimental test temperature: 12°C (n=7), 14°C (n=6) and 17°C (n=8). We acclimated juveniles to the control temperature of 12°C for 4 days before the first round of flipping (as described below) at that temperature. Then, after we returned them to their sea table, we ramped up the sea table temperature to the test temperature over the course of a week, in 1.2-1.3°C increments per day, such that the stars were held at the test temperature for a minimum of 48 hours before flipping (see Fig 9). 24 hours before each flipping performance trial, at noon, juveniles were moved into an experimental temperature controlled box at the target temperature for continuous video recording of behavior for an unpublished study on motion tracking as an alternative to flipping as a performance metric. The following day at noon, juveniles were removed from the box and flipped continuously for 10 minutes while being recorded at 2 frames per second with a usb camera (Basler a2A2600-64ucPRO) controlled by a custom python script. Following flipping the juveniles were moved back into the sea table. Flip rates were then measured in post with a custom python graphical user interface.
